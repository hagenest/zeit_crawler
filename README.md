# leitmedien

leitmedien saves metadata from rss-feeds of major German news sites. The goal is to perform data analysis in the future. It is currently heavy **wip**, you probably shouldn't use it.

## Dependencies

- python3 (duh)

It is recommended to install python dependencies into a virtual environment, preferably through virtualenv. Conda will most likely work too.

- feedparser
- beautifulSoup4

## Container / Server setup

Will be added soon-ish, if it doesn't crash anymore.
